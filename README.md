# aurelienberra

This is the source code to <https://aurelienberra.org>. My personal website is created using [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/), a static site generator written by Steve Francia, and the [Kube CSS framework](http://imperavi.com/kube/). It is based on designs by the logician [Greg Restall](http://consequently.org) and the sociologist [Kieran Healy](https://kieranhealy.org).
